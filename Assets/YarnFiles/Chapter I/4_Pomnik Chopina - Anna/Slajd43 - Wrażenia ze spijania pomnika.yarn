<i>Oh... Frederic... Now? Only now you are playing for me...? This music of yours is so beautiful. It makes me feel so good. Alive again. It is emotional and powerful. I am powerful. But this dissonance I hear... Why is it there? Is it because I hurt you? Is it because you feel pain? But your pain is my delight. Thank you Frederic. Thank you for that, my dear friend.
