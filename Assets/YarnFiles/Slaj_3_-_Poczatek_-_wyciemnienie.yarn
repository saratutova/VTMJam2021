<i>A void and nothingness.</i>
<i>At the beginning there was nothing but that. But…in fact…what is the beginning? Is there a place for any beginning in the void?</i>
<i>The void and nothingness…</i>
<i>A silence. Darkness and shadows. Shadows that were pulling everything under.</i>
<i>The Blackness…</i>
<i>I do not know why but it was a proper word. <b>The Blackness.</b> I remember it. The evil force. The Vortex. The memory was slipping away… I hold on to this memory with all my strength and will.</i>
<i>I stood on the edge of the Blackness. They wanted me to jump but I didn’t. I refused. Why? Why did I disobey?</i>
<i>Maybe because I knew there was no way back. I couldn’t come back unless HE allowed me. This was the point of no return. So I refused...</i>
<i>There were consequences of crossing that line. However, there were also consequences of disobedience. But it was the best from the worst choices. So… I refused. And they couldn’t make me obey. But they were able to make me suffer… To use me as they pleased.</i>
<i>An overwhelming sense of desolation. Fragmented imagery. Needles. Glaring unbearable light. Pain. Syringes. Grief and anger.</i>
<i>How?</i>
<i>Why were they doing this to me? “The greater good” they said.</i>
<i>Wait? Who were “they”?</i>
<i>Laying in the middle of nowhere. Being full of anguish…</i>
<i>I lost my bearings.</i>
<i>A cryostasis chamber. <cspace=1em><b>The cryostasis chamber.</b></cspace></i>
<i>I wanted to get rid of this awful word from my mind.</i>
<i>Do I still exist? Or am I just a fleeting thought in the mind of a madman?</i>
<i>I don’t know...</i>
<i>The void and nothingness.</i>
………………………………………
“You need to wake up.”
<i>Sudden, urging words.</i>
<i>What?</i>
<i>Do I actually hear it? Or is it just a voice in my head?</i>
“Come on. Wake up. You need to hurry.”
<i>Is it my mother? She wants me to go to school? No… Wait. I am not a child anymore.</i>
ME: Leave me alone.
<i>I tried to change a position on the bed but I couldn’t. Something was keeping me still.</i>
<i>A silence. A few seconds passed… Or was it an eternity?</i>
<i>I wanted to stay in that peaceful void. This void was not good but at least there was no pain in it.</i>
<i>But then I heard it again. This irritating voice.</i>
“Wake up. This is your last chance! You need to wake up!”
ME: No. You started to feel anger.
“Wake up. Wake up. WAKE UP!”
